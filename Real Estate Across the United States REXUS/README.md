# Real Estate Across the United States – REXUS Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of real estate assets across the United States using the REXUS dataset. It focuses on identifying patterns in ownership (leased vs. owned properties), construction trends, geographic distribution, usable space, parking capacity, and regulatory flags. The analysis is supported by structured SQL queries, a Power BI dashboard, and a detailed insights report.

# Key Objectives:
Understand the distribution and prevalence of leased vs. owned properties.
Analyze construction types (buildings vs. structures) and their volume.
Identify key cities and counties with the highest concentration of properties.
Evaluate trends in construction over time (2000–2025), highlighting periods of change.
Summarize property features such as ANSI usable area and total parking spaces.
Interpret ABA compliance flags and identify missing or unconfirmed data.

# Main Insights:
Over 77% of constructions are leased, with a significant spike between 2007 and 2009.
The top cities by number of constructions include Washington, Laredo, and El Paso.
There are more than 8,000 buildings and fewer than 1,000 structures in total.
Usable space reaches 38.8K ANSI square units, and parking availability totals 428K spots.
ABA compliance is mixed, with responses distributed across "Yes," "No," and "Will Confirm."
The counties with the largest total parking capacity are the District of Columbia, Prince George’s, and Jefferson.

# Project Structure:
DATA/ – Includes the CSV datasets used for analysis.
SQL/ – Contains SQL scripts used to query and manipulate the data.
Visualization/ – Includes the Power BI dashboard (.pbix) and a folder of screenshots.
Documentation/ – Contains the final report with findings and strategic insights in PDF format.

# Tools Used:
SQL (reusable scripts)
PostgreSQL (SQL queries for managing dataset)
VS Code (reading CSV as text to adjust format)
Power Query (Automate cleaning and normalization of data from CSV files)
Excel (Refine data cleaning)
Power BI (Data modeling and relationship management between multiple tables + dashboard creation)


This project serves as part of a broader data analytics portfolio and demonstrates the ability to work across datasets, extract insights, and communicate findings through professional visualizations and reports
